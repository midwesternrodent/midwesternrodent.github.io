## Guinea Pig Fight Club

Introducing new guinea pigs to a herd is always a stressful experience for the pigs, and can be even more so for their owners if they don't know what to expect. Guinea pigs are incredibly social and do best in groups, and their health and life expectancy can be impacted from living alone. You should never keep a guinea pig alone if you can avoid it for this reason. However, they must establish a proper dominance structure. [The alpha wolf idea is certainly a myth](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-the-alpha-wolf-idea-a-myth/), but the alpha guinea pig? Well, that may be another matter entirely.

Now, the former science teacher in me needs to emphasize that there is frustratingly little research on guinea pig social behaviors that I can find out there. So I can't really say that they do the dominance dance because they're establishing a pecking order, but that's the nomenclature that has developed around guinea pigs so I'm going to use it here. However, it could be just as likely this is the guinea pigs learning to communicate with each other and set boundaries on behavior. I haven't found any research to back up any reason for this behavior, which is frustrating considering how much guinea pigs are used in scientific research but that's a rant for a future post. Just know the dominance dance is something you will see happen with your pets, and there are great guides online about how to guide your pigs through this process, there just isn't a lot of actual formal scientific research into this phenomenon as far as I can tell. I'll specifically call out the guinea pig forum as they have [one of the most comprehensive guides out there](https://www.theguineapigforum.co.uk/threads/bonding-and-interaction-illustrated-social-behaviours-and-bonding-dynamics.167042/
) and it was incredibly useful to us the first time we did introductions.

What is lacking in online circles even, is just how intense this dominance dance can be without there actually being any problem between your pigs. I'm not going to recreate some of the excellent guides out there on how to do introductions with guinea pigs, but I do intend to show you the kind of behavior you can expect when you first introduce your guinea pigs because it can be very worrying but you need to be sure you don't interfere unless necessary. Constantly introducing and separating guinea pigs can be stressful for them as they need to re-do the entire dance all over again.

## Reader Introductions

Some introductions are in order for you, the reader, on the current slate of guinea pigs in my home.

At present, we have 4. Vanya and Klaus are our oldest and we've had them the longest. Before my partner and I knew each other back in 2019, a classmate of hers told her about some guinea pigs that came into their animal rescue that were found in their cage next to a dumpster behind a convenience store. Vanya and Klaus were thrown away with their cage. She picked up the pigs from the rescue and has had them ever since. I've known these two since my partner and I started dating in April of 2023. They've lived with me since May of this year when my partner moved in. My partner really loved these piggies but to be completely honest, I was indifferent and didn't really want any pets until she moved in and I got to know their personalities. Now I can't imagine having a home without pet rodents, as you might've noticed from the general vibe of this website and my online presence in general. I'm kind of obsessed.

Mai and Ty Lee joined us in June of this year. Similarly, a coworker of my partner called her because their relatives had dropped off two intact males at their home. This coworker has a male guinea pig who had just lost his mate so it was a perfect pairing they were told. Their relatives had bought them from a pet store a few months prior for their kids, but the kids weren't interested in them anymore so they wanted to re-home them somewhere that could take good care of them. After they were dropped off in a dog crate that was their only habitat, the coworker realized these two intact males were in fact two intact females, which is when we were called. When we got Mai and Ty Lee they had never had hay and would not eat it when offered, they also would not eat pellets. They were only being given an unknown foraging blend of pellets and like with most foraging blends they picked out the dried fruit that is terrible for them and left the rest. They were in general in very poor shape health wise, very picky eaters when it came to fresh veggies, and they hated being handled to the point they were endangering themselves trying to jump out of our hands. After we had a brief quarantine, they learned to eat hay from Vanya and Klaus, and were also taught to be far less picky eaters by Klaus eating everything in site. We also acclimated them to handling so they both now at least *tolerate* being picked up and accept their fate and stop squirming once they have been. They are now quite healthy and happy adult sows.

## Why do we need to re-introduce?

Back about a month ago, Vanya became rather aggressive towards Ty Lee. After taking her to the vet, we spent way too much money to find out she had some pretty bad gas. We were given some medicam for her pain and fixed her diet until she felt better, but unfortunately during that time she managed to get into some tussles with Ty Lee and managed to hurt Ty Lee's ear. She did not ever intentionally bite Ty Lee, but her repeated "get away" nips resulted in some gnarly sores on Ty Lee's ear.This injury made it look like Ty Lee may have had ringworm and we did not want to give that to our older pigs, fortunately that came back negative.

Originally we separated just Ty Lee out of concern she might spread ringworm to the other pigs, but she was very distressed until we re-united her with Mai. Ty Lee actually hurt her eye and needed medicated eye drops for a week because she tried to squeeze her head through a one inch hole in our divider to get back over to Mai. The plan has always been to re-introduce everyone once we knew they were all healthy because when they are, they do like each other quite a bit. We are now at that point, but since it's been so long, we want to make sure we do this on neutral territory and give them a clean scent free cage with lots of treats to go back to when we're done. And since the first time, we were not prepared for the absolute thunderdome that is introducing guinea pigs, we want to make sure we document it so others can be aware.
